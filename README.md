Some of the projects are as follows - 

* Image Classification
Objective: Train a neural network to classify images into 43 categories related to traffic signs.
Key Points:
Used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with two convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dropout.
Trained the model with a specified number of epochs (EPOCHS = 10).
Loaded image data from a directory structured with subdirectories for each category.
Utilized the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the neural network.

* Shopping Prediction 
Objective: Develop a model to predict customer shopping behavior based on various features.
Key Points:
Utilized a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for training the model.
Loaded data from a CSV file containing various features related to user behavior.
Evaluated the model's performance using sensitivity and specificity metrics.
Provided results including correct predictions, incorrect predictions, true positive rate, and true negative rate.

* Text Search and Matching
Objective: Implement a text search and matching system using TF-IDF.
Key Points:
Loaded text files from a directory for corpus building.
Calculated IDF values for words across files and sentences.
Allowed the user to input a query and returned top-matching sentences based on TF-IDF and query term density.

* PageRank Algorithm Implementation
Implemented the PageRank algorithm in Python for ranking pages within a corpus.
Developed functions for crawling HTML pages, creating transition models, and calculating PageRank values using both sampling and iteration methods.
Ensured that the PageRank values were normalized and reflected the importance of each page within the corpus.

* Minesweeper Game 
Objective: Create a Minesweeper game representation and an AI player.
Key Points:
Implemented a Minesweeper class to represent the game board and a MinesweeperAI class for automated gameplay.
Used logical statements (Sentences) to represent the AI's knowledge about the game.
Implemented methods to mark cells as safe or mines and update the AI's knowledge.
Included functions for making safe moves and random moves in the game.
* Movie Database Management
Developed a movie database management system using Python, where names were mapped to corresponding person_ids, and person_ids were linked to movies and vice versa.
Implemented functionalities for loading data from CSV files into memory and resolving ambiguities in person names.
Utilized dictionaries to efficiently store and manage information about people, movies, and stars.

* Gene Inheritance Probability Calculator
Created a Python program for calculating gene inheritance probabilities based on provided data.
Utilized conditional probabilities and mutation rates to determine the likelihood of having a specific gene and exhibiting a trait.
Implemented functions for loading data from CSV files, computing joint probabilities, and updating probability distributions.
